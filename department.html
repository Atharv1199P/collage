        <h5 class="mt-4">1. Computer Science</h5>
        <p>
            The Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) department focuses on the study of computers and computing,
            encompassing both theoretical foundations and practical applications. It covers areas like computer
            architecture, programming languages, software development, and computational science, with specializations
            in fields like AI, data science, and cybersecurity. CSE graduates find diverse career opportunities in
            software development, data science, AI, cybersecurity, and more.
        </p>
        <h5>2. Civil engineering</h5>
        <p>The civil department, or civil engineering department, is a branch of engineering focused on the design,
            construction, and maintenance of infrastructure, buildings, and public works. It encompasses a wide range of
            areas, including structural engineering, transportation, water resources, environmental engineering, and
            construction management. Civil engineers play a crucial role in shaping our built environment and addressing
            societal needs related to infrastructure and the natural environment.

        </p>
        <h5>3. Electronics and Telecommunication (E&TC) department</h5>
        <p>
            The Electronics and Telecommunication (E&TC) department focuses on the design, development, and application
            of electronic devices, circuits, and systems, particularly in the realm of communication. This field
            encompasses both the hardware and software aspects of electronic systems, with a strong emphasis on
            communication technologies.
        </p>
        <h5>4. Electrical engineering</h5>
        <p>
            Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of
            equipment, devices, and systems that use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an
            identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after the commercialization of the electric
            telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution, and use.
        </p>
        <h5>5. Mechanical engineering</h5>
        <p>
            The mechanical engineering department focuses on the design, analysis, manufacturing, and maintenance of
            mechanical systems. It involves applying principles of physics and mathematics, along with materials
            science, to create and improve various machines and devices. This field has broad applications, including
            robotics, aerospace, automotive, and more.
