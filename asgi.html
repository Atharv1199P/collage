            Sou. Sushila Danchand Ghodawat charitable trusts, Sanjay Ghodawat Institute Atigre", Kolhapur is established
            in the year 2012. It is the growing institute imparting technical knowledge and skills to the students and
            society at large. It is an unaided Institute located in Western region of Maharashtra.

            Sou. Sushila Danchand Ghodawat Charitable Trust's Sanjay Ghodawat Institute started in the year 2012 with a
            vision to impart the best technical knowledge and skills to the students across the country. Its aim is to
            build and provide the team of young technocrats who will be the leading catalysts in the development of
            society and nation at large. Currently, the Institute runs five different degree & diploma engineering
            branches such as Civil, Mechanical, Electronics and Telecommunication, Computer Science and Engineering and
            Electrical Engineering with the total intake of 300 & 420 in first year resp. and more than thousand
            including all years currently. Also ITI and Shortterm Courses are available at SGI.

            The MSBTE has given Excellent REMARK under its External academic monitoring process (EAMC). The Laboratory
            of the college from Electrical Department has got BEST LABORATORY AWARD with first rank and prize of Rs.
            50,000 throughout Maharashtra. Many students have got remarkable achievements in all the MSBTE Board
            examinations. Many students of the college have got good placements in national and multi-national companies
            of well repute. The Institute stands for performance par excellence.

            In the world where it is commonplace to see mediocrity as the order of the day, SGI always stands as the
            guiding star of brilliance, quality and deliverance beyond expectations. Innovativeness and Creativity are
            the hallmarks of a genius enterprise and SGI stands to be a stage where these qualities would be nurtured,
            encouraged and blossomed. Inner re-engineering towards a proactive outlook, courage to convert challenges
            into opportunities and an unyielding spirit with never-say-die attitude is expected from students, staff and
            management who are present in the grand precincts of the Institution. The genius is incomplete without the
            sense of social responsibility and SGI's ultimate goal remains the development of an attitude of gratitude
            that freely gives back without expectations.
